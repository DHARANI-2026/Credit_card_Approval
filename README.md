Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline to predict loan approval status based on various features using multiple classification algorithms. It compares model performance, provides detailed evaluation metrics, and visualizes the results.

🚀 Project Overview
Data Generation: Synthetic dataset with 1,000 samples and 10 features.
Data Preprocessing: Feature scaling using StandardScaler.
Model Training: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
Evaluation: Model accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Visualization: Performance comparison and confusion matrix for the best model.
